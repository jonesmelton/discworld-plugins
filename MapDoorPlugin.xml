A warren of tunnels seem to riddle this ancient cliff, branching off at odd angles and strange directions like a giant nest built by ants on slab.  Passages carved through the solid rock of the cliff branch off in each cardinal direction here, while an intricately carved staircase spirals along one wall, up into the heights of the cliff\."},
  [8]   = {"HashishimCave", "^The northeastern section of this enormous cave looks no different from the other parts\.  The rough stone walls curve up until they stop being a wall and start being a ceiling, albeit a somewhat bumpy and shadowy ceiling\.  The cave continues to the south or west, or \(for the particularly adventurous\) to the southwest\."},
  [9]   = {"HashishimTunnel", "^A musty, dark tunnel leads southwest into the side of the cliff\.  The floor is covered in sand, and the walls have been roughly carved from the sandstone cliff\.  The bright light from outside the tunnel is almost blinding to the north, contrasting starkly to the gloom of the tunnel\."},
  [10]  = {"DelbertsPub", "^This pub is the most popular part of the docks for many of the often travelling sailors\.  There is a bunch of men singing loudly - and drunkenly - on and around one of the tables\.  Another group of burly-looking sailors is in a corner, drinking away their troubles and their senses\.  On the bar is a menu, but it can hardly be read through all the alcohol spillages\."},
  [11]  = {"HillshireInn", "^This pub is the most popular part of the town for many of the local residents\.  There are a bunch of men singing loudly - and drunkenly - on one of the tables\.  A couple of burly looking farmers are drinking away their troubles and their senses in one corner\.  On the bar is a menu if you can read it through all the alcohol spillages\."},
  [12]  = {"GrflxPassageDown", "^Deeper in the chain of caves which bubble into the dark, the light is dim and prospects dimmer\.  There is a whiff of unimaginable horrors which invades the nostrils when the mass of caves exhale, the clean air of outside a distant memory, polluted by the caves above\.  A remote sound of water is ubiquitous and explains the dank closeness of the place\.  The caves persist where light fails to the west\."},
  [13]  = {"MadStoatCentre", "^This open space of packed earth would appear to be Mad Stoat's interpretation of a village square\.  The soft blanket of night has settled on this part of the village, drenching the road in shadows\.  To the west and to the north stand the faint silhouettes of a number of cottages\.  Further north, the road curves off into shadows\.  To the south stands the slightly ominous looming outline of a large, sinister house\."},
  [14]  = {"MadStoatCentre2", "^If there were a village square in Mad Stoat, this would be it\.  Perhaps village oblong would be more appropriate, but at any rate, as open spaces of packed earth go, it's very functional\.  There is a row of cottages to the west and to the north which, upon close examination, are unremarkable in every conceivable way\.  Further north, the road curves towards Lancre Bridge\.  Far away to the south is a house that doesn't seem to quite fit in with the rest of the village\.  It gives off a faintly sinister air\."},
  [15]  = {"LancreCoOpBank", "^This is the head office of the Lancrastian Farmers' Cooperative Bank\.  It is a rather plain room with what appears to be very thick and solid walls\.  To one side, a sturdy, wooden counter sits protectively in front of a rather impressive looking vault door\.  A sign hangs upon the wall\."},
  [16]  = {"BPSionWallJunction", "^This is the northeast edge of the Sum Bing district where Wall Street meets Sion Street\.  The great wall dominates the view, and its enormous shadow is enough to make anyone feel intimidated, which may explain the attitude of the citizens here\."},
  [17]  = {"BPImperialChampionJunction", "^Imperial Avenue, a rather impressive avenue, runs east towards the Imperial Palace, and west towards the Sum Bing district\.  Long-dead emperors - or rather, their stone effigies - keep watch over the street, standing in neat lines on either side of the street in between strange-looking trees\.  A short length of red tiles connects Imperial Avenue with Champion Way, a heavily-crowded street encirling a massive stadium to the south\."},
  [18] =  {"AMCockbillStreetFish", "^This is near the north end of Cockbill Street\.  The street continues through the shops and stalls to the north and south\.  A vacant stall to the west catches people's attention, and a featureless building lies to the east\."},
  [19] =  {"AMFishShades", "^Cheery yellow paint has been slapped on the walls in an attempt to brighten up this shop\.  It doesn't appear to have worked\.  A few bright and tacky posters advertising the glories of Fish are stuck haphazardly to the walls and a glass tank full of fish is neatly placed on one end of the counter\.  A colourful sheet has been hung on the north wall, it seems to be an improvised curtain covering the door leading to the back room\."},
  [20] =  {"AMPlazaSE", "^The southeast corner of the Plaza is a popular gathering place for many of the vendors in Ankh-Morpork\.  People of all races and creeds wander it, weaving their way between the many stalls set up across the ground\.  The Plaza stretches away to the north and to the west, where most of the action is\.  A heavenly smell wafts out of the shop to the south, and another shop lies to the east"},
  [21] =  {"AMPlazaTShop", "^The eastern side of Plaza of Broken Moons is just as busy as the rest of this area\.  The Plaza is a popular gathering place for many of the city's vendors, and people of all races and creeds wander around in search of a good bargain\.  They seem quite prepared to haggle, or yell if need be, until they get one\.  The Plaza stretches to the west and continues north and southwest from here\."},
  [22] =  {"RamGiants1", "^The mountain path narrows as it passes between two sheer cliff faces to the southeast, the trail resembling a crack through the sheer mountainside\.  To the northwest the trail continues through the mountains\.  The rocky landscape is clothed in an almost impenetrable mist, reducing visibility to your immediate surroundings\."},
  [23] =  {"RamGiants2", "^The trail travels between two sheer cliff faces\.  The cliff faces loom overhead, rising several hundred feet before the sky becomes visible\.  The canyon opens out to the southwest\.  The rocky landscape is clothed in an almost impenetrable mist, reducing visibility to your immediate surroundings\."},
  [24] =  {"RamGiants3", "^The path travels north and east between two massive scree-covered slopes here\.  Some of the stones having fallen onto the trail forcing those passing through to pick their steps carefully\.  The rocky landscape is clothed in an almost impenetrable mist, reducing visibility to your immediate surroundings\."},
  [25] =  {"RamGiantsBrigands", "^The canyon is so deep you wouldn't be surprised if no sunlight ever warmed its rocky bottom\.  By the time it reaches here, it's probably time to leave again\.  The canyon opens out to the northeast, and a narrower trail heads southwest\.  The rocky landscape is clothed in an almost impenetrable mist, reducing visibility to your immediate surroundings\."},
  [26] =  {"HolyWoodPShop", "^From the vantage point of this alley, the backs of the shops that line the main street are visible\.  The only way to tell what they are is to see them from the front, however\.  The alley continues west and east"},
  [27] =  {"KlatchBasiliskSand", "^This is still the desert, but appears to be some sort of creature's nest\.  An odd smell pervades the air here, one that is definitely on the unpleasant side of 'pungent'\.  The sand has been pushed aside into a large mound with a depression in the middle\.  Tracks are everywhere here, running over each other, making it hard to tell where they might be going\."},
  [28] =  {"AMThievesEntrance2", "^The northern side of the entrance hall of the Thieves' Guild is just as busy as the rest of it, though not quite as well lit or cared for\.  Shady figures lurk in the corners, though their dark clothing makes it a difficulty against the pearly white of the marble walls\.  Huge tapestries line the walls, ornate scenes woven to depict memorable moments in the history of other guilds\.  An unremarkable door is set into the middle of the north wall, leading outside to the guild gardens\."},
  [29] =  {"AMThievesEntrance1", "^A magnificent dome covers the spacious entrance to the Thieves' Guild, supported by solid walls of veined marble\.  The dome itself contains several stained glass depictions of the most memorable events of thievery, all overshadowed by the image of Mazda stealing fire from the gods\.  A large statue of Mazda is centered under the dome, holding aloft the fabled Undying Flame to represent the rewards of his skill\.  A broad stairway sweeps majestically up along the north wall, leading westward and upward, mirrored on the south wall by an identical stairway\.  A wide corridor leads to the west, while the entrance hall stretches out to the north and south\."},
  [30] =  {"AMThievesCorridor1", "^Corridors branch off to the north, south, and east, while a room to the west seems to be acting as both corridor and classroom\.  Only Thieves can be seen using the westward exit into the relatively new building adjoining the old court house that the guild now calls home\.  The back stairway is here, leading to the great hall on the upper level and down into the shadowy uncertainties of the basement and cellar\.  Few adornments grace the walls, due to general lack of room for them with all the corridors instead\.  Traffic flows constantly in all directions with few passersby stopping for more than a moment or two to get their bearings\."},
  [31] =  {"RamtopsCreelEastExit", "^Birdsong echoes through the branches, as brightly feathered avians flutter amidst the leafy trees\.  The light filters greenly through the canopy to illuminate a small, but well tended path which leads east towards Mad Wolf, and wombles west, toward Creel Springs\."},
  [32] =  {"RamtopsCreelPoolEntrance", "^The water in the pear-shaped pool occasionally bubbles, causing ripples of wavelets to dance in ever increasing circles across the shimmering surface until they lap soothingly against the banks\.  The most notable thing aside from the pool and its hydrological activity is the little hamlet on the southern side of the pool\.  The path leads northeast and southwest from here along the banks of the pool\."},
  [33] =  {"IILLibraryEntrance", "^This is the entrance to the library of the Djelibeybi Institute of Illusory Learning\.  There are shelves of books of all descriptions which start just a little bit to the north, east and west\."},
  [34] =  {"IILLibraryGap", "^This is the library of the Djelibeybi Institute of Illusory Learning\.  There are shelves of books of all descriptions all around you carved into the limestone walls\.  You can't help but notice there is a gap in the shelves here\."},
  [35] =  {"DJBPalaceExitNight", "^The sheer number of torches here makes it seem like the sun barely set\.  The light illuminates the grand marble steps leading up to the palace entrance and reflects off of the great bronze doors\.  The palace dominates the square and here in the centre of the north side its imposing form makes looking at anything else almost impossible\.  Massive stone pillars flank the entrance supporting a vast lintel, made from a single, huge, block of marble embossed with the cartouche of the Pteppicymon dynasty\.  To the south, in front of the palace, the square spreads out in all directions while to the east and west the palace stretches out on either side of the main entrance\."},
  [36] =  {"DJBGuardExitNight", "^At night the splendid entrance to the Djelian Guard is lit by torches, placed in sconces on the two, huge, hieroglyph covered, stone pillars on either side of the arched entrance\.  The light from the torches illuminates this part of the Square of Ancestors\.  The bronze doors of the Guard stand open and shine in the torch light beneath the massive triangular stone slab that the pillars are supporting\.  To the north and west the square spreads out in front of the palace, the massive statues along the sides of it standing watch in the darkness\."},

-- ********************************************************************
-- * Location Database - Each must have a unique short-room-name key! *
-- ********************************************************************
--   The main key is the 'short room name' in square brackets (from a verbose look, not a glance)
--   The data stored by each is firstly the "map-ID" relating to the list of "Map Files" above
--   Next is the X and Y location of this position (pixel co-ordinates for that graphic file - to be centred on)
--   If a 4th variable is present, and set to 1 - this is a special clause and the map will only snap to this point IF
--     it is a map that wasn't already loaded - handy for teleporting in/out of a street that doesn't have a unique short name
--     From another building - eg from inside Patrician's Palace to the outside "[Turnwise Broadway]" street room
--   If the 4th optional variable is set to 2 - similar to the above but will only "snap" if the location is 3+ rooms away
--     You can see this used when going downstairs and upstairs from the thieves guild basement to the non-unique corridor room
--     And then moving along the corridor with the same short-description
--     You can provide a 5th argument if the 4th is a "2" - this is "only track to this position if <5th argument> or more rooms away"
--     But this defaults to 4 rooms or more away if not provided
--  If the 4th optional variable is set to 3, then this location is ONLY used if still on the SAME map - never if it means changing maps
--  If the 4th optional variable is set to 4, then provide a 5th variable to say which map number MUST have been loaded before this one
--     This is used for linking maps with non-unique names - eg check the Mano Rossa "front garden" - it only loads if you came from the
--     Genua map ID [27]
